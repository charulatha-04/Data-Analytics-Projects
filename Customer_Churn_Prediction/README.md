ðŸ“ž Customer Churn Prediction
Tool: Python (Google Colab)  
Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn  
Algorithm Used: Logistic Regression  
Objective: To predict whether a customer will churn (leave the service) based on demographic and account-related features.

ðŸ“Š Key Insights
- Achieved an accuracy of 81% using Logistic Regression.  
- Features such as tenure and contract type significantly influenced churn.  
- Identified at-risk customers for retention campaigns.

### ðŸ“ˆ Process Overview
- Data preprocessing (handling nulls, encoding categorical data).  
- Train-test split and model training.  
- Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
